# CSCI261FinalProject

Final Project for CSCI261: Programming Concepts. This project uses the SFML library to create a graphic of a randomly generated maze. 

The A* Algorithm then attempts to find the most optimal path from where the user clicks to the bottom right corner of the screen.

Data structures such as vectors are used extensively. Pointers were also used to manage memory.

This project is my first implementation of an original class and other object-oriented concepts. 

This is also my first attempt at implementing a complicated algorithm such as A* on my own.

This project was heavily inspired by the YouTube channel The Coding Train. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k&t=23s
